We want children and adults alike to have fun and enjoy our products. They should not have to consider safety when it comes to toys, therefore our dedicated compliance team are here to take that worry away. At One For Fun, products go through a long assessment and testing process and are not launched until we are sure that they are safe.</p><p>As part of our standard operating policy, our team evaluates each product to identify any possible hazards or associated risks at the point of selection, and then during the product’s development stages. Without this total assurance, we would not be placing these items onto the market. Our toys are tested to EN71 standards by independent accredited test houses, which use their technical ability and expert opinion to ensure that our toys are safe. Where toy products are marked with CE, it indicates compliance with the Toy Safety Directive, and we compile European Declarations of Conformity (DOC) for each product.</p><p>To assist in helping customers, we are able to provide the following documents:</p><ul><li><h6>Bill of Materials – shows a full list of component materials that our products are made from.</h6></li><li><h6>Test Reports – tests against European standards carried out by accredited thirty-party laboratories.</h6></li><li><h6>EC Declarations of Conformity – the product’s official legal document that states applicable safety directives to which the product complies.</h6></li></ul><p>We work closely with our test houses so we are always aware of any impending changes to legislation and regulations. This allows us to plan for these amendments up to 18 months in advance.</p>",
